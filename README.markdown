# Custom Preferences

## Stop thinking of Static Sections, Custom Preferences are come!

This extension adds a backend page that allows you to edit static sections as if they were system preferences. The purpose of this extension is to provide authors with a nice interface for editing single entry sections that should be treated like static content.

* Author: Simone Economo
* Version: 0.2.1
* Release date: 2010-09-01

## Usage

Enable the extension from your "Extensions" page, then go to "System -> Custom Preferences". Every section that is both `static` and `hidden` is listed here, along with its fields, to make you edit its single entry as a list of preferences.

Please note that _Publish Tabs_ fields are treated as fieldsets. Every field that comes after a Publish Tab in the section editor will be added to the same fieldset until a new Publish Tab follows.

## Installation

Custom Preferences depends on both [Static Sections](http://github.com/knupska/static_section/tree) and [Publish Tabs](http://github.com/nickdunn/publish_tabs). In order to make it run properly you must have these extension installed and enabled.
