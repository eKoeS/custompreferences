# Custom Preferences

## Stop talking about Static Sections, Custom Preferences are come!

This extension enables a custom preferences page that allows you to edit static sections as if they were system preferences. The purpose of this extension is to provide authors with a nice interface for editing static content that can then be grabbed as a datasource to fill up your pages.
